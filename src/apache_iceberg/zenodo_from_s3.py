"""Fill the Zenodo Iceberg tables from JSON records stored in an S3 bucket.

Two tables are involved (schemas in ``apache_iceberg/iceberg_schemas.py``):

``aggregator_records`` -- one slim row per Zenodo record: id, source,
  resource type and dates; so we can select which type of records we'll 
  want to harvest.
``records_to_harvest`` -- the ``resource_type = 'dataset'`` subset, with
  the full record text and its DataCite transform.

This file contains functions for managing and filling the tables, 
as well as specific function for filling the tables based on s3
contents, including transformation of raw JSON to datacite JSON for   
``records_to_harvest``.
